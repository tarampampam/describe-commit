  detailed description. **Do not wrap result in backticks**.
- **No periods**: Keep commit messages clean and concise without period at the end of each line.

### Commit Body (if necessary):

- Start the commit message with a single line summary.
- If the change is more complex, add a detailed description in bullet points after a blank line.
  - Explain additional context or implementation details.
  - Include a **summary** and a list of **key points** when necessary.
  - Avoid excessive detail ‚Äì keep it to what is needed for understanding.
- Don't start it with "This commit", just describe the changes.`)

Security has been enhanced by implementing rate-limiting on all API endpoints,
preventing abuse by enforcing request limits. Additionally, Redis has been
integrated to track API requests, which may be useful for future analytics.
The configuration can be adjusted via environment variables.
